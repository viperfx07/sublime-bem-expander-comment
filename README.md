BEM Expander (for Syntax Highlighting for SCSS)
=====================

On https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass#comment-tag, you see that the comment tag needs to be wrapped in `{{` and `}}`. This needs quite a lot of effort to do that and there's no documentation about it how to achieve it quickly. By using this simple plugin, you don't need to type anything. Just press `Ctrl` + `L`, then it will automatically add the comment for you.

It uses the SCSS Expand library from https://github.com/garetht/sublime-scss-expander. It's a great plugin that you need to checkout as well
